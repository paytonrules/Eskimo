### When Quinn the Eskimo Get's here - everybody's gonna jump for joy

Eskimo is a framework for developing 2D games in JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas.  The framework is being actively extracted from game development, and such is under very active development.  The goals for it are:

  * Testable without a browser (node)
  * Simple to Install
  * Loose coupling to the application logic
  * Hides the boilerplate of creating numerous games
  * An opinionated architecture.  You should do things the right way.

Eskimo's current feature set is small, but ever growing.

  * Drawing of 2D shapes 
  * A fixed step game loop
  * Asset loading
  * No Canvas or JQuery knowlege necessary
  * Handling keyboard input (but your game must handle input as well).
  * Command-line testability with node.

Eskimo is at version -0.200 at this time, because it is far from finished.  The current features to be implemented are:

  * Sounds
  * Sprite Sheets
  * A "keystate" so that your game doesn't need to think about input.
  * Particles
  * All kinds of awesomeness I haven't thought of yet

#### Using ####

Directions are to come. At the moment, git/clone, read code, learn JavaScript, get smarter. Send me messages saying I suck.

#### Why Eskimo? #####

My youngest son is named Quinn, this framework is nicknamed after our nickname for him ("The Mighty Quinn").
